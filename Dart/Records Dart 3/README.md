# Records

## Requirements
Records require a language(Dart) version of at least 3.0.



1. Records are an anonymous, immutable, aggregate type. Like other collection types, they let you bundle multiple objects into a single object. Unlike other collection types, records are fixed-sized, heterogeneous, and typed.

2. Records are real values; you can store them in variables, nest them, pass them to and from functions, and store them in data structures such as lists, maps, and sets. [For More Information dart.dev](https://dart.dev/language/records).
